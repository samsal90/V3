"Great location where you could easily access to city centre and riverside. A classic hotel with onsite parking (£17 per day) was good. Room size for 4 occupants was not bad, clean and tidy.

"On arrival we realised that the room didn’t have everything listed in the online description. There were no bedside sockets, no seating area and no alarm clock. There was also only one bedside table for 4 occupants. It was like half the furniture in the room had been removed. Whilst bathing our children we also discovered that the shampoo dispenser had not been refilled and was completely empty.  The next morning, I requested that these be resolved, partly expecting to be offered a different room but instead I was told that the furniture would be sorted out, we would be given an extension cable for the sockets, an alarm clock would be provided and the shampoo would be refilled.  When we arrived that evening, the ‘seating area’ turned out to be a single dining chair, no extension",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/549ciar_nj,Ciarán J wrote a review Apr 2023,Ciarán J,,3 contributions,,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r886113818-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,"Beautiful hotel, shoddy experience",Date of stay: April 2023,,,,

"Friendly welcoming to the hotel, clean tidy reception area, miller and carter on site with nice bar area.  Room clean and tidy. Comfortable bed. Great access to the city centre all within walking distance allowing the car to be left in the car park below the hotel, however limited security within the car park, sadly our car was ransacked during our stay :( only to be discovered upon leaving the hotel, unfortunately we were not the only ones at the desk at this time reporting this. Upon reporting this to reception they were apologetic and I was informed this wasn’t the first time recently therefore I would suggest if you are parking here to remove anything and everything from your vehicles!! - the car was locked when we left it luckily for us nothing of value was actually inside.",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/13jessj,Jess J wrote a review Mar 2023,Jess J,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r882855558-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,"Lovely welcoming hotel, shame about the car park ",Date of stay: March 2023,,,,

The Miller and Carter restaurant was very busy on the night, but despite travelling on my own they managed to find me a table. The food was excellent and reasonably priced.

"Hotel ambience on entrance is lovely. Very grand reception area. Lots of good points noted throughout the stay and the staff are welcoming, friendly and attentive.  A few improvements....  Breakfast is a bun fight (quite literally).  Greeted by a friendly person, but I think long hair should be tied back when working in or around food delivery areas.  There's no system in place or order to breakfast stations so it's full of people going back and forward and clamouring for their choices. A one way system or signage would help this. For instance there are plates at either end of the hot servery which is confusing. Sauces available at one end only which is awkward.

"Stayed here for one night, but unfortunately it was not overly comfortable. On the positive side the room was spacious, with complimentary waters and toiletries ( although I don’t favour the refillable ones, as previous guests could tamper with them). The location is great, near the theatre, lovely restaurants and bars and the aquarium and harbour. Unfortunately the bathroom was tiny (especially for 4 guests) with little vanity space and stiff, thin towels. The duvets were wafer thin too, so we were cold in the night and kept waking up. There was a beeping in the corridor too which kept us awake until Reception were called to sort it out. Breakfast was busy but well stocked with fresh items. The system however is strange.

"This is a large, comfortable hotel in an interesting building with good staff, but I feel it is not making the most of its best assets. First, the room. This was fine, with with a good bed and bathroom, very clean, all the usual facilities, though a frankly horrible painting of a trumpeter on the wall did nothing to improve the rather grey decor. More importantly, the bedroom window was sealed shut. So there was no way to ventilate the room. Surely the pandemic should have made hotels aware of the crucial importance of fresh air - closed internal ventilation systems are not enough. And apart from the health aspect, most people want to be able to open their own window!  Second, the Palm Court on the ground floor.

"The Marriott Royal has held a special place in our heart for over a decade.  We were married here, we held my mums 60th birthday here and it is (was) our go to hotel.   We don’t get many nights away now as our daughter is disabled and arranging overnight respite care is extremely difficult.  This is why when we do go away we like to go somewhere luxurious.  Unfortunately the Marriott is slowly stripping the luxury away. We were so excited for our stay, we were looking forward to using the pool and the spa area but alas it is no more.  Just an extended gym.   This really disappointed us.    The rooms have supposedly been refurbished but this just means a lick of paint. The furniture is the same chipped and dated mahogany furniture that has been there for over 12 years.

"We had yet another fantastic stay at this lovely hotel.  On arrival the staff are welcoming, friendly, polite and efficient.  We were quickly ushered to reception and although we arrived early they checked if our room was ready.   It was not but it was no problem to leave our luggage and go into the city.    The room was immaculate,  and all facilities were available and working.  The bed was extremely comfortable and it was easy to serve the room environment to where we wanted it to be for us.

Our room was really spacious and as I was with my Son we had a double bed each, really comfy, lovely pillows and bedding,the room over looked a courtyard. There is a coffee machine with pods if you like coffee, everything you need in your room. Ironing board, hairdryer, plenty of towels.

This is an exquisitely beautiful historic building with the benefit of modern design and luxury.

Especially the wonderful Marewan on reception who came to our assistance several times at all times of the day and night. I’m disabled and MIL is frail and his kindness and support made our stay safe comfortable and special.

"Clean and good service but the overall decoration is a bit tired.  An overhaul for modernisation is rather needed.  It was a 6 nights stay.

Hotel staff helpfully relocated us to other rooms on high floor once alternative rooms became available (after spending 4 nights, with 2 more to go).

"I had the unfortunate cause of needing to come to Bristol to visit my daughter who had unexpectedly been admitted to hospital. I booked one night, with the expectation that she would be discharged the next day. This sadly did not happen, nor the next day nor the next... Kim on reception was absolutely wonderful. Each day she arranged for me to keep the same room, with a late check out of 4pm at no extra charge. She was efficient, empathetic, warm and genuinely concerned for my daughter’s health. She really made a horrible situation so much more bearable. Nothing was too much trouble. The housekeeping staff were also amazing- as I was unsure if I would be staying or going for a few days, they made up my room for me on demand, at varying times of the day. I have to say this was",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/JoozUK,JoozUK wrote a review Oct 2022,JoozUK,"London, United Kingdom",291 contributions,108 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r865046715-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Absolutely perfect!,Date of stay: October 2022,"Response from James Laverick, General Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"Excellent location in the centre by the cathedral and docks.   Superior room was fair - a little dated but a very comfortable bed and a Nespresso machine. Slept very well. Bathroom was fine but no bath and small shower. Mini bar was an empty fridge.   Staff on reception very pleasant and welcoming.   The breakfast feels very three star; not what I would expect of a higher end Marriott. Crowded buffet. Only filter coffee. Not a relaxing place.  They need to up their game on this.   Car park was full so I had to park by the docks. Lots of poorly parked cars taking up two spaces or 4 by 4s which can’t fit into the very narrow spaces; they need to look into this.   No lounge for higher elite Bonvoy holders.

The positives:  Comfortable bed Clean room Nice building from the outside City centre location  The negatives:  Inadequate staffing on reception- lengthy wait to check in  The breakfast service is very poor - being asked a room number on three occasions is excessive- but having to ask repeatedly for a hot drink is unacceptable  The hotel is dimly lit The room was not a four star one.   Poorly lit.  No minibar.   Bad lighting in the bathroom - hard to shave when one side of your face is, through the hotel’s design, in total darkness  On arrival I was told that the only room of the standard I booked was in the lower ground floor - yes - the basement.

Stayed for 3 nights as a family of 3 - great room overlooking the street and didn’t have a problem with noise from the street.

"Lovely hotel situated right by the water front. Not too far from train station about £8 in a taxi.  We used this as a base for our hen do party. On arrival they had our rooms ready early which was perfect. Nice large clean rooms. Large shower with plenty of hot water. We had a room for four, they had only left two towels in the room but on speaking to reception within five minute two further towels arrived.  Would definitely revisit due to its location!

"Well the room is clean and bed comfortable. The service at check is very distasteful, very rude, dismissive and arrogant reception manager. When querying a bill charge as previously the billed differently completely shut down. Not great customer service at all.

"We have stayed here a few times over the years , the last time was when it was mid refurb several years age. We were in Bristol for the recent Elton John concert so wanted somewhere central where we could walk to Ashton Gate. Check in is normally 4 but I messaged ahead in the hope of an earlier one. We arrived about 2pm , managed to get a space in the underground car park, bargain for Bristol at £17. (You can use the Millennium Square car park for overnight but more expensive). Lovely greeting at reception , and, yes our room was ready. Situated on the 4th floor , it was quiet and clean. Good air conditioning not always essential but needed when we were there as it was hot.

"Pre Covid, we have stayed at this hotel many times and always enjoyed the pool - which is now permanently closed, a very disappointing decision. The hotel still seems to think that covid rules (and excuses) still apply - they don't. Telling guests as they check in that the bar will shut at 10.45 but then being open when we returned at 12.15 is totally unprofessional. We made alternative (inferior arrangements) after our concert at Ashton Gate. I doubt we will return here again, when i am a guest in a hotel, i expect to be able 2 get a drink until a reasonable hour.",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/G_EvansWales,G_EvansWales wrote a review May 2022,G_EvansWales,"Brecon, United Kingdom",898 contributions,443 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r840578101-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Lost its pool and its lustre,Date of stay: May 2022,"Response from James Laverick, General Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"If you are going to drive there, bring a small car- navigating your way round the car park, never mind finding a parking space, was painful. So many spaces were not fully available thanks to the car in the next pace (most are in pairs) creeping over.  Check-in was painfully slow. The room was a farce- so outdated that I thought I had woken up in 1973. Two of the three windows (all of which were pretty small) faced a wall that was within 6 feet- nice. Dank, dark, with a massive pillar right in the middle, insufficient sockets, no mini-bar and dreadful art. There was an old fridge (in which it would have been nice to have had a pint of milk left) and the bed and pillows were fabulous. Still, at least it wasn't £300 for the night- oh, hang on, it was!

"I used to love coming to this hotel - it was smart, comfortable and so many helpful staff. Now there’s a few  shabby parts (peeling ceiling paint in the bathrooms), far fewer staff (all who are stressed and therefore not as available as they should/used to be) and even has a chain restaurant installed. But the worst thing - my room is 25C and getting warmer and they are doing nothing about it.  I’m here with my family and it’s a warm spell of weather and the air conditioning is not on. We have asked every half an hour to get it looked at but nothing. Most attempts to call front desk are left unanswered. Obviously I don’t know for sure, but my suspicion is that the staff are not allowed to turn on the air conditioning in April due to current very high electricity prices - they",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/bigtriton,Marc R wrote a review Apr 2022,Marc R,,2 contributions,2 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r834802788-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,"Used to be a good hotel, not anymore…",Date of stay: April 2022,"Response from James Laverick, General Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"We have stayed in the Marriott Royal for many years and enjoyed our stay. It is just over the road from the Hippodrome theatre which is perfect for us. If you want to be in a great place to sight see this is just right. Bristol Cathedral is steps away, the wharf is five minutes walk with its many restaurants - great for younger folk!  If you cross the water even more fabulous for young and old (can I say that 'old' word now?) several in containers,  do try Tere. Shopping is a short drive away if you have a car - which you can easily park in the Marriott Royal car park!  The hotel is nicely done, reception welcoming, rooms large with good bathrooms.

They wouldn’t serve cappuccino without an extra charge. Very unusual for a quality hotel. Fruit juice was poor quality and definitely made from concentrate. Omelette was good and staff very pleasant.

"Very disappointing. After arriving for one night, we decided to stay a second night. A catalogue of disasters followed. To start with our newspapers failed to arrive the following morning. We went out after a very mediocre breakfast to see The SS Great Britain ship (brilliant). Decided to go back to the hotel for a coffee in the bar, just to be told we had no (essential) credit at the bar, even though my husband had paid for it. We then went back to our room before going into the centre for some retail therapy, only to find we could not get into our room because reception had not extended our key -  frankly unbelievable.

Had one night in the Marriott Royal Hotel. The hotel is in a great location down by the river and handy for areas like Clifton. We had a large room on the third floor with nice views over an inlet to the river with some smart bars and restaurants. Overnight parking under the hotel for £17 was good value and very convenient. All that was great but the catering is provided by Miller & Carter and that was terrible. The breakfast was simply a bun fight - too many people accessing a buffet style breakfast that was constantly running out of choices and poor vegetarian selection. Food was poorly cooked and not very warm - overall the worst breakfast experience I have ever had.

If you want to have a coffee you need to trace it at the bar which is on the other side of the lobby.

"The hotel building is lovely.   We paid a fair price for location and quality of room.  Our suite had thick cotton robes, a comfort on chilly days.   The suite appeared recently renovated; however, the chairs arranged at the table were very worn/torn and there was also a little glass container of very dusty old potpourri on the toilet, strange that a room that looked fresh and clean would have these items, a sad contrast.  The bedroom was quiet which we appreciated after long days out.  Be cautioned of the 4 poster bed, if you are used to a soft side mattress.  The front desk staff, that we encountered, all came across as new and inexperienced.  Breakfast: Breakfast was on the low end for a Marriott property. The bread/muffins were cheap grocery store quality.

"A memorable hotel for its luxurious classic furnishings/architecture and spacious, modern- styled  bed and bath rooms. Great location, good views over the  city even from first floor room. The staff were helpful and polite, though overworked spread too thinly at check-in time (a surprisingly late 4pm) - perhaps this was an off day related to storm Eunice disruption, so might be fine another day.

Ask for a room on the top 4th floor for great views of the surrounding area and the cathedral.  The bedrooms were modern and felt fresh and clean.

I felt Covid-safe and even though the staff were in face masks (which I really appreciated) I could see the smile in their eyes. This made a real difference after a long journey.  I attended a conference which was being held in the hotel. The spaces were fantastic and the catering even better than I remember. As a first foray into face to face conferences, this was a great experience.  Dinner was held in the 'garden room' area at the Centre of the hotel which offers a wonderful space.

Tbh had sky sports in room which was an added bonus for once we’d got back from a days walking! As was a fridge so we could put our own drinks in.  Only downside, as a family room, I had read you had a view of the green or college- well, we had a huge brick wall outside our room - the side of a building I believe— if you craned your neck and looked as far to the left as you could, you could make a tiny view/gap Out of the area at the front of",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/MarkR453,Mark R wrote a review Feb 2022,Mark R,"Surrey, United Kingdom",154 contributions,65 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r828535237-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Good hotel and placement,Date of stay: February 2022,"Response from James Laverick, General Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"Firstly the hotel is situated in a perfect location to access all areas very easily, lots of places to eat, have coffee locally. Reception staff were very welcoming, nice entrance and family room comfortable with a good amount of space. Beds comfortable, shower good. Housekeeping good.   Breakfast was fine; I travel a lot for business and it is a fairly standard offering, buffet hot items, DIY toast, cereal in containers to help yourself. I was a little underwhelmed to be honest. I did ask the waitress for an Americano and was told I would have to pay extra for that!   I would give 3.5 stars if I could, but opted for 4 as feeling generous… one of the main reasons for this is the terrible sound proofing between the rooms.

I've asked the receptionist that I would like to pay for an upgrade, this was been ignored and I was given a room on 4th floor small and dark. After a room changes the 2nd room was slightly better but very bad on soundproof, I could hear the guest in the next room. After taking a bath there are no slippers any bathrobes, not a single bottle opener, my partner called reception requesting one, the receptionist mentioned that couldn't deliver since she was alone, to our surprise when we get to reception two receptionists were chatting with each other and putting makeup!!!

I stayed at this hotel a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed my stay so had no hesitation in rebooking for this stay. Unfortunately my experience this second time was very different. Firstly I waited 20 minutes to be checked in. This was due to the fact that only 2 receptionists were available at arguably the busiest time of the day. After that delay I was in a rush to drop off my luggage and meet my friend for dinner so paid little notice to the condition and cleanliness of the room. I returned late and again did not notice anything amiss as it was so late and I was very tired. The next day I was surprised to see that the sink in my bathroom was filthy - see pictures. It looked as though it had been cleaned inside but not underneath.

From the first greeting at check-in to leaving was excellent, nothing was too much trouble.  Hospitality establishments are often let down by poor service or rude untrained staff.

"When booking this hotel, it seemed quite pricey but we it was an ideal location for a wedding we were attending so we bit the bullet and booked!  I am so glad that we did, what a lovely hotel.

The room was comfortable, quiet and had everything that you would want it to have.   There is a very large car park underneath the hotel which always had a space available and it was secured at night (although do remember to get the entry code if you go out at night!!).  Location-wise, you are just a short walk from the town centre and nightlife so it was perfect.

"Stayed at this hotel for a short one night stay, we were welcomed by Sylvia at check in, so helpful, polite and cheerful, we had requested an early checkin as we needed to drive on  to Cardiff to watch the rugby as check in is quite late ( 4pm) we received a text at 10:30 am letting us know our room was ready, which was a great help to us. Our room was spacious and very clean, we overlooked the beautiful art gallery room, the hotel was busy however our room was so quiet and we had a peaceful nights sleep. The hotel is situated next to the river and many restaurants /bars along the river where you can grab breakfast at a much cheaper cost then the £15.00 per person the hotel charges.

"My wife and I have been loyal supporters of the Marriott Brand for many years, having been guests at their hotels across Europe, & North America.  On this occasion we had a short week end stay, in celebration of our anniversary.  We were checked in at the front desk by the delightfully professional Ellie, who could not have been more helpful in answering our numerous requests, concerning travel, and places to visit, and her advice ensured that we made the most of our short time there.  The imposing hotel is in a perfect location to act as a starting point for travelling around Bristol, and is also centrally located.

"First, the positive things. The location is great, the building is beautiful, and some of the staff was wonderful.   Secondly, the negative things. When we checked in, they told us that they won’t clean the room unless we asked for it. Considering what we payed for the room, that was a bit off. One thing is to not change the sheets and towels every day, but to not clean at all? Despite us asking them to clean (one day we had to ask four times), they were slow and did not provide us with enough toilet paper.   The internet was also horrible. We were told that the internet was included, but what was included was an internet speed of 1,5-2,1 Mbit/s. Normal internet speed is usually around 20 Mbit/s.

"We stayed in a top floor 'suite', this comprised a larger room with sofa area, and a further bedroom. It was actually two bedrooms with private connecting corridor was used as two rooms when the suite wasnt booked. Rooms were serviced every three days as standard. This meant that when our room wasn't serviced in the morning we had to call to enquire why - seemed strange given the cost of the room. The decor and furnishing was adequate, but not particularly special. The image of the lounge area use in the marketing photos was actually a side room off reception, which in itself was uninspiring.

"Utterly mediocre experience. Booked a suite as a special treat for a weekend away. On the plus side the parking was convenient and the room made available for an early check in, but it went downhill from there.  Living area of the suite reeked of cigars. Floor hadn’t been vacuumed and one of the bins hadn’t been emptied.   Whilst housekeeping remedied the latter two points, nothing was done to try and mask the foul smell, putting the living room out of use for us and leaving me wondering what I paid for.  Room poorly stocked for 2 guests - one dressing gown, one packet of biscuits, miserly offering with toiletries.  By 7pm there was no hot water available either and around 10pm that evening I ventured down to the bar to get a drink to take back to the room. Wow.

After 3 minites a lady came to get our bags. She was sweet and we thanked her. Then we were told to basically "" Be quiet & shut up""!! I couldn't believe this welcome we got as guests on my sisters 40th birthday! I was so mad at this welcome. We went out and tried to enjoy are day.

Not enough plugs for ipad/cell/laptop as it is obviously an old structure building. One of the two lifts was broken and out of order for days and there was delay sometimes. To have breakfast you need to make a reservation in case breakfast is not in ones package. This is something i experienced first time in my life and i am a regular traveller around many places. Not correct in my view, as residents should have been reserved enough places even if they decide to have breakfast last moment. In general it was ok.

"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night over the bank holiday weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel is fabulously located in the centre of Bristol close to shops and restaurants etc. We drove into the carpark early at 10:15am and located a space straight away. The carpark is tight but there are lots of big 4x4 cars in here so you can still park comfortably you may take up 2 spaces that’s all. £17 for 24 hours.  We headed for reception to be surprised to find our room was ready. We were handed an anniversary card and small box of short bread biscuits in celebration of our anniversary. The staff all had masks on and are very friendly, helpful and welcoming. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and immaculately clean.

We stayed here on a Friday evening to attend an event nearby. The car park underneath the hotel is very tight and split across multiple levels. There's also no electric vehicle charging which is disappointing considering the overnight rate is £17 for hotel guests.  The hotel was clean and staff very friendly although directly outside the hotel seems to be a gathering place for younger people drinking on the street/green area.  There was a fire alarm set off very early in the morning by somebody drinking who came in to the hotel. Obviously not the hotel's fault directly but there wasn't much organisation from the staff on duty once we were all outside waiting with no update.,,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/Spennymoore,Spenny wrote a review Aug 2021,Spenny,"Llandogo, United Kingdom",293 contributions,68 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r806412658-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Good hotel in the very centre of Bristol,Date of stay: July 2021,"Response from James Laverick, General Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

Great hotel in a fab location.  The hotel was lovely and clean with helpful reception staff and right next door to the car park.  Our room was spotlessly clean with a great size telly.

"There are cheaper hotels in Bristol, and we are normally tempted by the reliability of a Premier Inn, however the Bristol Marriott Royal is a favourite of ours. Parking on-site is a convenience we're happy to pay for, and the location is fabulous, with the harbourside, good restaurants, museums and attractions right on your doorstep. We visited Bristol Cathedral (free) next door, the M Shed, and We The Curious + the Planetarium. The atmosphere in this part of the city is great, with salsa classes going on in Millenium Square and Capoeira martial arts in the nearby Lloyds ampitheatre. Hospitality is stretched at present with the pingdemic so I would recommend booking restaurants several days in advance as everywhere is very booked up.

While our room on the first night was gloomy without a ground level window, we were moved on the second night to a lovely room with a view of the cathedral.  Thank you to Sylvie who was so gracious in finding us a new room! This is a classic hotel that has been nicely upgraded and everything seemed clean and well-maintained. Staff were professional and the only downside is that the location (right downtown) was crazy at night with lots of drunk people on the streets, making it hard to arrive or leave the hotel or get into the parking lot.

Have stayed here quite a few times now. Right in the city centre but with a good secure car park underneath which costs 17 pounds for a 24 hour period. Whilst this is on top of your room rate most Bristol hotels don’t have any parking and you have to walk to NCPs etc so this also encourages us to go back to the The Royal over other hotels. Hotel has had some recent refurbishment and our room was very nice.

It was impossible to get a dinner time on our first night as residents between 5.15 pm and 10.30 pm.  Food and bar are run separately by Miller & Carter.  Breakfast on the Sunday morning had to be pre-booked and was only available on our check-in before 7.15am and after 10.00 am.

"My wife and I stayed there in June of this year for a few nights in a superior room on a high floor.  Our room was spotlessly clean and a good size although the view down to the harbour was spoilt by the dirty windows. Check in was quick and even though we had turned up early our room was available for us, staff were courteous friendly and professional throughout the hotel.

"As a previous Bristol resident, I have always admired this hotel from the outside and was excited to finally have an excuse to stay. It has to be said that as a base from which to enjoy the city, it can't be faulted and we loved the shared spaces downstairs including the tea lounge and the courtyard garden space. Unfortunately, considering the price, I was disappointed by our room that had what we needed, but lacked any thoughtful detail and only basics were offered. It also felt jarring that both parking and internet were additional charges whereas in other, more affordable places, they have been included (the internet was actually reimbursed but only after agreeing to sign up for the hotel app).

Our car parking charges are matched with the hotels in the vicinity and the area to provide an affordable parking service to our guests. Due to the location of the hotel, our parking is also very demanded both from guests and non guests, for which we discounted the rate for the firsts (£17.00 per 24 hours) from the latter (£35.00 per24 hours).

There was just something missing - there didn’t seem to be much to do during our stay.

We stayed in the ""newer"" extension,  but despite the quality bedroom & bathroom fittings, we found the room very dark, oppressive, and quite depressing.

"Last year we booked to have our Civil Wedding Ceremony only at the Bristol Marriott Royal hotel, then COVID-19 appeared out of no where and changed everything! Having forced to downscale our wedding we decided to hold the entire day at the Marriot including the wedding sit down meal.   Throughout the whole process the staff at the Marriot hotel especially the event manager, Chris Luke, was completely understanding and was always willing to go the extra mile to help us have our day in the best way possible under the COVID-19 restrictions.   The team at the Marriot made our families feel so comfortable and accommodated to our every need and wish. They were attentive to everything!

"The hotel suited us in terms of position in the city, we were able to walk to many attractions and restaurants. You will not starve here.  We have stayed in other refurbished Marriott properties in the UK, we booked a ""superior"" room, it does not exude quality as we have experienced. However, the cost was less than other places.  Breakfast was served, it was hot, it was tasty. Service was attentive. However, not different to a Premier Inn or similar.   We had plenty of towels, daily mineral water was replenished, bathroom cleaned, good housekeeping services.  The room design - why do modern hotel designers feel they need to create a dark room? Do these people never stay in a hotel?  I was going to entitle this review - do you shave or put on makeup in a hotel room?

"This hotel was not the same Marriott standard I’m used to and expected. Disappointed with the stay, wouldn’t choose here again. Room 1259  - dirty coffee cups in room that obviously hadn’t been changed since previous guest. The previous guest of the room must’ve dripped coffee on them and then they hadn’t been changed... gross! And super unhygienic in the current covid environment - see pic  - the bedding had two stains (we did complain and the bedding was changed) however still did not feel comfortable or clean in the room afterwards - see pic  - shower glass did not close properly so water went all over the floor like a lake in the bathroom (we also told reception about this, there was no one around to fix it, so they gave us some extra towels to put on the floor) - see pic  -",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/Zyq90,Zyq90 wrote a review Oct 2020,Zyq90,,25 contributions,23 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r774719344-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Not the usual Marriott standard and cleanliness - wouldn’t stay again,Date of stay: October 2020,"Response from Borja Serrano, Guest Services / Front Office at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"When you walk into the hotel it looks absolutely lovely. Can’t fault the public areas at all. However, the room is a completely different story. We paid £115 plus £17 a night for the room and parking, you’d expect something decent. The room wasn’t very clean, it was dark and really outdated. Huge stains on the carpet, sink blocked (you can see how filthy the plug is in the photo) and just grubby all over. We were right at the end of a corridor which I’d suggest to avoid, as it was really noisy with the overhead pipes outside the room. Such a shame and a let down. I’ll never return here again.

"I have stayed in this hotel scores of times. Its Covid discipline in the ground floor, public areas and the corridors when compared to Marriott Eden Park and Marriott Worsley (both of which I have stayed in within the last month) is disgraceful and irresponsible. Groups of young smokers in the entrance portico without masks, people checking in without masks people openly walking through the hotel without masks without challenge or encouragement. On Saturday 4/10/20 it was clear young females were coming in from outside, using the toilets in the hotel without masks and no porter or doorman (which there usually is) to interrupt them.

We really appreciate your comments, specially in these times where we have to change our procedures and processes in order to comply with the Government guidelines and to ensure the health and safeness of our guests, which is always our first priority.  We inform our guests in advance that face covering is mandatory in all the public areas in the hotel except the bedrooms. This is reinforced by the signage that we display in all the public areas, along with the social distancing signage that we put in place to create awareness of this safety measure. All our staff wears face masks and we have screen shields in Reception to create a barrier between guests and staff while checking in or out. We also have put hand sanitizing dispensers spread around the hotel to provide with antibacterial foam at leisure for our guests and complimentary packs of sanitizing wipes in the rooms. All these measures go beyond the requirements that Hospitality is required to have and we always look for new ways and improve our procedures to increase the sense of safeness in our guests and staff.   In regards to the Restaurant and the times available, social distancing practices have reduced considerably the availability for each time slot, having to pre-book a table in advance to ensure that we follow protocols and to provide with useful information in case the Track and Trace team contacts us. I am sorry if the times available were not what you expected but I hope that you understand that all the procedures implemented are there to provide a safe environment to everyone that comes to the Royal.

Easy to pick up taxi and under immediately outside and convenience stores and restaurants very close by.

I booked a room at the Marriott on College Green for my wedding day! It was ideally located in the centre and close to the church.  We arrived way before the check-in time with thinking that we would have to leave our bags at reception but the staff at reception did their best to check us in as they had our room already prepared for our arrival! (At 11am!!!) I think the receptionist was called Mya.   I also needed some stationary printed (groom's speech) printed last minute and Sylvie at reception did this for me which saved me some extra stress (definitely not needed on this day)  Our room was on the second floor and we had plenty of space to get ready!  The room was very clean and the hotel too!

"Stayed 3 nights.................  Dusty room. (Asked for a deep clean and my name etched in the lamp base was still there after the deep clean!). Tops of lamps dusty.  Noisy aircon.  Wet bathroom walls due to dirty/clogged extractor in bathroom.  ""All the windows on that floor are locked shut for safety reasons"".....so why does the room 2 along from us have an open window?  Furniture with gauges and lumps knocked out of it.  But the Duty Manager could not come and witness these issues as he had not been trained to enter a guest room due to Covid!   A hotel guest in the main Tea Lounge, with bare feet on table..........disgusting. But the Duty Manager could not do anything about that!  Don't be dupped into paying the high rates.

Last minute booking the night before when travelling by car from London and needed car parking. Hotel offers car parking onsite for a charge. Our booking included breakfast which was very organised and served in Millar & Carter Restaurant within the hotel. Covid safety measures were reassuring and you had to circle on menu what you wanted. We asked for extra towels as we had decided to stay longer and these were promptly delivered in a bag. Enjoyed walking through the hotel and learning some history it is a fabulous building and well located in a busy area for restaurants etc and for a visit to the theatre when they are up and running again.  ,,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/Scozziemythbuster,Scozziemythbuster wrote a review Sept 2020,Scozziemythbuster,scotland,255 contributions,264 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r771821995-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Great Value - we even extended our stay,Date of stay: September 2020,"Response from Amanda Murray, Guest Services / Front Office at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"We booked the sister hotel but had our booking changed to the Royal. We were apprehensive  about being in such a busy student part of Bridtol,in the present circumstances. However  we were given a quiet  room  and though the hotel was buzzing  we could escape  into a comfortable space.  Great beds,  every convenience and space to move.  A  large modern shower room with even a heated mirror.   Everything so clean.  We dont eat  much breakfast so avoided that. There is sadly no choice of where to eat  it's the steak house only, and room service is sourced from it too. One dinner was enough for us, it not being our sort of food.  A  word about the Covid restrictions is perhaps helpful. Mostly folk were wearing masks and trying to distance.

We loved our weekend here in Room 1279. From check in to check out and everything in between we were very happy. There were the usual few numbskulls who seemed to love not wearing a face covering as a mark of defiance but the hotel did all that they could to encourage COVID compliance. Good and plentiful served breakfast from a decent menu. The room was very well appointed with a wonderful and very comfortable king sized bed. Great bathroom with a superb shower.

I communicated my requests via chat on my app on phone and all requests (extra amenities) were dealt with within minutes - great service again.

The room was large and nicely furnished.......as was the bathroom with all the little toiletries that are usual with the Marriotts. The room also had a fridge and a safe plus tea and coffee making.

"This was our first time away since lockdown ended and like many were a little apprehensive about not only staying away from our hometown but also eating out and mixing with others. It's worth remembering that we are still in the middle of a pandemic and hotels and restaurants can only do so much to try and make us 'safe' the rest is down to us.  The hotel didn't disappoint in it's thought and preparation for guests safety.  On arrival there are signs to wear a mask in public areas, hand sanitiser stations at the entrance and at touch points on the ground floor, rooms are equipped with a small pack of disinfectant wipes for those who want to give an extra clean of their room.

Superb hotel. We stayed a couple of times several years ago and wanted to return. The hotel had been refurbished since we were there last and looked stunning. As it was the last evening for the eat out offer and we had tried and failed to find a restaurant other than one which had a table at 21:30. This was rather late so Mya who on reception made several phone calls and managed to get us an earlier reservation. She went above and beyond being helpful. The male on reception with her was extremely pleasant. It added to a wonderful peaceful stay in the most comfortable of beds.

We booked here to be near the Hippodrome for a show.  The room and bathroom were beautifully clean and it had all the usual accessories.  The view from the window was a wall and a flat roof.  What I found out in the night was that the flat roof seemed to be for the power plant room and there was a constant buzz/hum all through the night.  Then at 6.30am it was time for a boost to the hotels systems.  That wasn’t funny. We ate in the restaurant in the evening and it was a tale of two very different meals. I chose a salmon dish with risotto and some small green vegetable.  The salmon was ok even though the skin was a bit soggy.  However the risotto was only just warm and the vegetable was hard and not at all pleasant.

"Beware room types, no pool & spa anymore, climb 3 flights of stairs to the carpark and most of all the worst service I've ever experienced at a Marriott:  LAZY DOORMEN Two doormen/bellmen watched us unload our car with a lot of luggage, watched us pull it inside, then watched us struggle with it at reception, watched us get a trollley and clamber into the lift - just watched and smiled. No offer of help at all. Disgusting.   BEWARE ROOM TYPES Booked the highest category of 'room' before a Junior Suite and seemed to end up in the Attic. Nice view, but tiny room with tiny bathroom. Aircon rattled all night. Door rattled too as it wasn't tight.

"Had a short stay at this hotel, half term, with our grandchildren. Used the underground car park. Very difficult to access the hotel with lift out of order. Although the lift is not run by the hotel I would think that they could have made an effort to rectify the fault (out of order since mid December). Some rooms in the hotel are a distance from the lift, difficult for someone with walking issues. Most of the channels on the TV were not working. We were offered a refund on our parking but still awaiting the refund to our account.  The hotel is in an excellent location on College Green.

"I stayed here twice. Once as a single traveller in December,  and again as a couple in February.  The hotel is spacious, clean and has very comfortable beds. The building is very grand and beautiful.  The first time I stayed, I was very happy here, with my only complaint being that the television didn't work (no signal on any channel). Sadly, 2 months later in a different room, I found exactly the same problem. When I tried to call reception a few times over a 30 minute period, I got no response so decided to go and speak to them in the reception area. On the way I met a porter and asked if I was dialling correctly.

"The Royal is an impressive and wonderfully imposing building located next to the picturesque Bristol Cathedral on College Green and a hotel that I’ve wanted to stay in for some time so the opportunity to enjoy a concert at the nearby St George afforded me this at last!  After negotiating the tight but welcomed car park, I was disappointed to find the lifts out of action so lugged my bag up the stairs.

The price of the hotel room is still the same even though there are less facilities.

Apart from one of those is a lot cheaper. The mattresses are also hard as others have mentioned... another cost saving i presume.

"The Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel is a nice looking hotel in the middle of the city. Easy accessible by car as the hotel has its own parking garage. The staff is very friendly and helpful. and made us feel at home from the first minute on. The rooms are not super spacious but large enough for a few nights. The bathroom only has a toilet, a sink, and a shower. there was no bathtub in my room. The hotel also has a beautifully decorated banquet room called the Palm Court. See my picture. During my stay there where to negatives; the noises heard from outside can be pretty loud at night and there was a bad smell in my bathroom the last night which smelled like putrid stench.

He loves staying in hotels with a pool and was terribly disappointed after checking in this afternoon to find the pool had been removed in October! This is not made clear on the website, as it still states it has a spa and a fitness centre, so it is easy to assume this includes the pool if you have stayed before.

Most establishments strive very hard to achieve excellence and work with consumers to better themselves. However in this case I am writing.  The Royal Hotel is an icon, a slightly faded and gracefully aged lady of high repute and a certain gentleness, long lost in todays world, the staff were always highly professional and courteous with a charming manner. Sadly all has been lost, the staff have replaced with clones, lacking disregard for the most basic of services, the beautiful luxurious albeit a little aged but with a smallest amount of tweaking would have smartened up beautifully, has closed and gone forever.

"The good points about this hotel are its proximity to the centre of Bristol - its lovely location beside the cathedral and College Green - the spacious rooms, the luxurious downstairs areas (lounges, etc.) and, at Christmas, it's beautifully decorated. Another good point is the staff - nearly all those we encountered were very courteous, pleasant, helpful and professional, especially the reception staff. The less impressive points include: a superior room, within the superior room wing, with only one small window - too high up to see out of - and so the bedroom and en-suite were dark and oppressive; a second superior room that we were shown to, which was spacious and had a large window, but it looked out onto a high brick wall - this was absolutely all we could see from it.

The airco did its thing but it still felt very warm throughout the whole hotel including the room. You can't open the window so that's no help.

Aircon in room won’t turn off soo be prepared to get hot or cold air blown on you in bed until temperature reached. Leisure club not properly finished and gym is 24’c with no way to alter the setting yourself. Also, it is only accessed from stairs near reception so if you take any other lift it is greyed out which gave me the initial impression it was closed.

Despite initially being told we should have booked in advance - at least 1.5 hours apparently - the staff went out of their way to produce an enjoyable afternoon tea and are to be thanked for the effort they made and the willingness to go the extra mile despite the time it took to prepare. The spicy deep fried cauliflower was especially flavoursome and this slightly unexpected element in the mixture of a more typical afternoon tea was the highlight. The Coronation chicken sandwiches were good as was the smoked salmon oatcake - the cucumber sandwiches were less good. Scones were a little heavy but the clotted cream saved them - it would have been nice to have had home made jam rather than standard catering small pots.

One of the most expensive hotels in Bristol so I had high expectations. And the rate does not include breakfast.   My room was in the basement with a small and very dirty window overlooking a road at the rear. I may has well have been in an airport hotel. This made me sad as I was treating myself to a luxury night away.   If I wasn't tired I would have asked to change rooms.   Bedding is nice but the bed is very hard.

"Stayed one night whilst out on the town in central Bristol. I am a Marriott Platinum Member so was upgraded to a suite on the M floor.   Classic Marriott comfortable room and bed. Everything you’d expect from a hotel of this class. The suite bit was nice but we didn’t really use it! Didn’t really use anything else in the hotel such as breakfast as we arrived just in time to get ready for the night out, had a lie in and then left.  The car park cost £17 for the night (about a 50% discount on published rates) and is accessed to the left of the main entrance. Don’t believe Google maps which will deposit you at the car park exit if you follow it.

"It was real shame to find out that the Leisure Cub with its Roman bath-style pool, sauna, steam room etc closed on the 14th Oct after more than half a century. The only item left on the lower ground floor is the gym (and you need a code from reception to use it).

Had visited this hotel previously and was very disappointed this time. The pool and leisure centre had closed down between booking and staying there and WiFi is now charged for unless you become a Marriott member. Breakfast is now served in the adjoining steakhouse which could not cope on a Sunday morning. We stood and waited over 10 minutes at the buffet as all bacon egg sausage and mushroom was empty. It then came a bit at a time so not at all satisfactory. That said the food that was available was very good. The hotel operates a strange cleaning system where all glass bottles and unneeded room items seem to be left by the cleaner outside rooms waiting for a later collection.

Lovely to revisit this fabulous historic hotel !  Upgraded to a junior suite which was superb with two large screen TVs (perfect for my son to have his own room/tv and watch the rugby!).

The check in was painfully slow as they had a large group of young ladies checking in and only 2 receptionists on duty.

Room 1415 had neither as the room was too small to fit them in. We had the desk chair but no desk. Other Deluxe rooms were twice the size.  The kettle was hidden behind the tv as there was no where else for it to go as you couldn’t fit even a small table into the room.

"Spent one Saturday night here in late August.  The hotel is in a great old building that is conveniently located near many of Bristol's main attractions.  It is well maintained and our room appeared very clean and spotless when we stayed there.  I last stayed there five years ago and since that time the entire catering operation at the hotel has been outsourced to Miller and Carter, a UK gastropub chain.  This has meant the separate original bar area has been ripped out , and merged into the wider main restaurant.

"This was the perfect location for me: it is well placed for someone wanting to visit and look around the city. Just one or two suggestions: it seemed extraordinary not to have any bottled water available in a 'deluxe' room, especially on such a hot day - especially when there were three empty bottles left to greet me outside the door on arrival. Only one teabag. Charging for wifi in this day and age seems rather ungenerous too. No response from room service when trying to order a meal: had to go to the switchboard. The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished, but perhaps not entirely in sympathy with its period: the foyer is somewhat minimalist, and could do with some seating for those like me who were waiting for a taxi, or other reasons.

"I stopped in this hotel with my parents. It was a nice hotel overall. The room we had was clean and the beds were comfortable. I really liked the room, so I can't complain about that. What I can complain about is when we went to Bristol Festival and the staff were meant to take our suitcases the room for us as we were out all day, but we got back at around 12 AM tired and they didn't put our suitcases in the room. We didn't want to be messing about as we wanted to sleep, but we had to sort it out. The staff were okay.  The breakfast was nice. I was glad there was vegetarian options. I like how they asked if I wanted tea or coffee and I said ""tea"" and they poor me some tea.

"The hotel is beautifully located right on College Green next to the cathedral and very convenient for the waterfront. The reception areas are light and airy. Very impressive.  Parking is at a premium so choose the underground parking offered at £17 per day. Unfortunately the lift to the car park was out of order during our stay and its 4 flights of stairs. The receptionist warned us at check in so we unloaded our bags before parking.   The room was everything you would expect from a 4* hotel, very comfortable, good sized bathroom and lovely large fluffy towels. The triple glazing was effective at blocking out the traffic noise from the street below.

"Not to be confused with the other Bristol Marriott a brutalist concrete monstrosity near the shopping district and north of Temple Meads station, the Bristol Marriott Royal adjacent to the cathedral and College Green is an altogether more sedate affair perfectly complimentary the statue of an elderly Queen Victoria which sits outside it. Arriving at 9.30pm on a Friday night after a journey on an overcrowded train from London we were probably not in the best of sorts. So it was frankly irritating to be told our upgraded family room was available but there was little point in taking it up as one of its beds was a sofa bed.

So we ended up walking around the top floor for the hotel for 10 minutes looking for other elevators whilst lugging two big suitcases.  The other issue we had, the bed was so so hard.

"The building is really beautiful, as it's a heritage building, and the rooms are nice because they've been recently renovated, but the service is well below par. The staff try their best, and are friendly, but there is definitely a problem in the way the hotel is run. Their computers are frequently down, the lines at the front desk are really long (which suggests it's taking longer than it should to process each customer); it takes forever to put in an order at the restaurant, which often comes out wrong. You cannot sign your bill to your room after a meal. So many little things are wrong with the way it's run. I feel bad for the staff, as they end up getting the brunt of the customers' frustration.

You can’t get a better location - it’s perfect for chilling on the green in the sun or hiking up park st to Clifton or exploring the dock area/galleries or the central area saint nics markets etc  It is an old hotel and the rooms are pretty dated - it could probably do with a refurbishment, but at the same time it’s absolutely fine - the bed was",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/Satdog,Satdog wrote a review Apr 2019,Satdog,"Suffolk Park, Australia",23 contributions,16 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r666698095-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Nice one,Date of stay: April 2019,,,,

"Oh dear oh dear, what have they done to this hotel?  It’s a Victorian building, you used to be greeted by a lobby with comfortable armchairs it looked genteel, warm and welcoming like one of those gentlemen’s clubs In Sherlock Holmes stories. It fitted with the architecture, it belonged. Now there is a vast cold looking open space.  As you stand facing the reception desk, on your right there is a bar and indoor neon lights - yes, really - advertising the company responsible for the “Steak Bar” which has replaced the old fashioned restaurant. Not quite sure who they are trying to attract with this, but I fear the hotel will not keep it’s old clientele and it will go down hill. The new arrangement is noisy and frankly down market.

We had booked the hotel because it includes a swimming pool.  We learn that the hotel pool has not been in use for several weeks.  If we had been told this at the time of reserving we would have booked elsewhere.  We were given a discount when we complained.  But that misses the point.

"Having stayed in Bristol a few times before, we thought we would stay in the Marriott Royal as it is a grand, characterful building with a pool, sauna and spa treatments available.  We stayed on a Saturday night and planned to  use the facilities after breakfast.

"I booked the Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel for a recent gig at the O2 Academy which is only a two minute walk away. Check in was easy and effortless and we were quickly in our room. The room was nice and had everything that was expected and was extremely clean, even the date stickers on the bed sheets of when they were washed. A nice touch having a bottle of water with the beverage making facilities. We were disappointed that the swimming pool wasn't in use during our visit as this was one of the main reasons we had booked this hotel on this visit. We had breakfast in the restaurant which was definitely worth the price and the choice was amazing, certainly a breakfast to set you up for the day.

"We have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions since 2006. It's good to see that there has been an investment for a refurbishment of the hotel, however disappointing for us was that the baths have been removed in many of the rooms. The staff in this hotel are excellent and the lady on reception managed to find a room with a bath.  Another change not particularly to our liking was the replacement of the hotel restaurant with a Miller and Carter steakhouse where breakfast is served.

The room seemed decent enough on the face of it and our late check in was facilitated ok. No complimentary bottle of mineral water to be found in the room which you might expect from a hotel charging around £130+ per night.  However, things got worse.

"This was our first trip to Bristol and as such we decided to try what we believed would be a better standard of hotel, sadly we've had better experiences in budget hotels.  Arriving at the hotel first impressions are good, the building is grand and the on site parking is a bonus, it's reasonable in terms of the location and at the time of writing it was £17.00 for overnight parking .The lobby are is clean and well maintained, it has a high class feel to the hotel with a smart looking tea room and cocktail bar directly off the lobby area.   Staff were efficient and friendly and our room was ready early which was a bonus.  The room itself was the standard room on offer, it was clean and well maintained and the bed comfortable.

My daughter and her partner stayed here on 5th January for one night.  The first thing they discovered was that leisure facilities were not open ‘due to unforeseen circumstances’ maybe this should have been mentioned when booking (which was booked on 4th). Next a deposit of £50 was taken on her debit card in case of extras purchased to be refunded on check out .......she still has not received this payment back into her bank account (nothing extra spent) - in our own business when we refund a customer on their card it is almost immediately back in their bank account ......apparently this is different with this hotel?!

"This was my favourite hotel in Bristol. I used to love Swallow Hotels. Then they were taken over by Marriott.

No real apology when I asked about it, I was just told that another customer had burnt their toast again. Move the toaster or change the sensor then! It obviously happens regularly enough. Also, I'm glad that I hadn't paid the £15 for breakfast if it meant cooking your own toast. I tried to use the website to leave a comment but couldn't find an option to do so.

The hotel was a stunning period building and fitted lovely throughout. It is in a prime location and everywhere we wanted to go was in a prime location. However. We booked a deluxe king room to find there was no king bed. When questioning reception their deluxe king is actually what they call a standard double which is highly misleading. The situation was rectified and they moved us to a king room. The breakfast was OK. However the bacon and sausages looked almost undercooked both mornings and there were always items missing and by the time they restocked we were ready to leave. No way worth the £15 or so a head when you can get a fantastic breakfast less than half the price at one of the local coffee shops just a walk away. Overall.

"The new revamped Marriott Hotel, restaurant/bar. The makeover is very interesting, the old time faded glamour of an old fashioned cocktail bar has sadly gone, replaced by modern grandiose. A restaurant had sprung up at the far end, very plush and dare I say quite pleasant. I ordered a steak burger and bacon with cheese burger. The bacon was far to salty, but otherwise fair.

I recently stayed at this Marriott while on business in Bristol.  I drove to Bristol so it was important that I be able to park on site. Some hotels in city centers say they have on site parking and it really isn’t but that was t the case here.

The bedroom I was given was on the Lower Ground - the window didn’t open and it smelt of damp/dust... Breakfast was hazardous.

"On first impressions, this Marriott is lovely. It’s in a great location close to college green and the city centre, and the room we had was good. The pool is also very nice.  However, it fails on two major points. Firstly, even platinum members have to pay for parking, where usually it is free. Also, if you stay over the weekend and need to take your car out for any reason, good luck in trying to find a space when you come back. It’s a small facility so there are inconsiderate drivers who park over two spaces, along walls so they block access to some spots, etc. The parking lot isn’t monitored by the hotel, but they should do if they want to offer their guests a more positive customer experience.

The first thing of note regarding this hotel is that WIFI is not free.  It is only free from the hotel lobby and is only available in your room for an extra cost.

"This hotel is fantastic on the outside a really beautiful building, however inside it is really dreary and in need of updating. The reception area is not at all welcoming ,in definite need of some ambience and identity. The bar area could do with a modern look it looks tired and dated and appears far too small for the size of the hotel. Staff were very pleasant . There appears to be some building work going on , only one of the main lifts was working (there was another but not well signposted).

Lovely hotel. Close to Hippodrome theatre BUT what a total shambles. It’s now 12.20am early morning and the walls are physically vibrating with the sheer loudness of a party downstairs.

"The Royal Marriott is meant to be one of Bristol's top hotels and they certainly price it as one. The location is excellent and the building is fabulous but the rooms are of the same standard as a nice travel lodge or premier inn.

The TV in the room was broken and when brought to the attention of the front desk they offered to move us to a different room ... it was 2am.

"From the quick and efficient check-in at the front desk through to the comfortable room with king-size bed and sizeable bathroom, this hotel offers comfort and good value for money. The car park in the hotel basement levels initially looks rather pricey at £35 for 24 hours but the hotel offers a special rate of just £16 which is really good value for a whole day right in the city centre.

"I stayed one day and one night at this hotel and normally a Marriott is reasonably good but this one was well below or in terms of quality and service. Despite going though a major refurb (all hotels have to at some point) which was not mentioned anywhere when I booked, the hotel seemed understaffed and under resourced.   When I arrived at 1pm, the corridors were full of dirty plates and rubbish from the night before and they were still there at 3pm.   The room had no bottled water which I thought was just an omission but actually they have stopped providing complimentary water so I had to go to Tesco to avoid paying silly money for water.

Visited the Marriott with my family for a weekend getaway and it's a great hotel. Staff are very friendly and the service is great. Rooms were a good size and well presented. What's particularly great is the location. Marriott royal is a great bar for everything in Bristol.

Only £16 and this includes all day on both days, so we parked at 2pm and had until midnight the following day if required. Also only a nice walk to the city centre. Reception staff very friendly and helpful, advised us where to eat/drink as well. A lovely touch was a room upgrade to a brand newly refurbished room and a complimentary bottle of wine due to us celebrating our anniversary. Very generous of them indeed.

Our only issue with the Marriott Royal hotel was finding it! We have usually stayed at the Marriott City Centre which is modern and in City Centre so we were pleasantly surprised when booking the Royal. It's old so the rooms were smaller but well maintained. There is no concierge floor but we enjoyed our complementary drink in one of the 3 bars. The restaurant was only just acceptable but there were restaurants in the area which were much better. The gym and pool are small but met some friendly locals. We liked the Royal well enough that we've booked it for our Oct 2018 UK trip. ,,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/Travellers1970,Travellers1970 wrote a review Aug 2018,Travellers1970,"St. Petersburg, Florida",254 contributions,151 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r603647765-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Old World Charm,Date of stay: June 2018,,,,

"A lovely hotel in a great location.  Easy to find.  Underground parking (not cheap, but convenient). Undergoing significant refurbishment. It's a very elegant and impressive building - both inside and out.  The bar is just off reception and has an outside terrace area. While the terrace is attractive it's surrounded by the hotel, so you don't get much in the way of views.   The dinning room whilst slightly dark is spacious and atmospheric. The food was very good.

Don’t just let people check in to experience workmen disturb your stay with heavy work on upper floor. This shows disregard to your guests.

Great spot in town. A little shabby and understand refurbishment works are about to commence. Staff friendly but check in was incredibly slow. Also called room service and was told there was a 45 minute wait so ended up coming down to the bar myself which isn’t what you expect. Good sized room but a word of warning we were on the first floor and the noise On a Friday night from revellers and police cars was horrendous - in fact it didn’t stop until gone 4.30am.

"Too many recent experiences of Marriott hotels that seem to deprioritise the need for cyclical maintenance. Hotel undergoing a major refurb (long overdue) with no warning to guests when they book.

No guidance on the leisure facilities location or the opening hours. Changing rooms at the pool dirty and covered in hair. Pool dark and in need of updating.

"We chose this hotel for our one night in Bristol because it had a car park (although £16 for overnight stay) and was close to the venue of our concert.  It is fabulously located for the waterfront and I'm sure for many other amenities but a bit sad inside.  Upgrading and refurbishments are taking place but even our re-furbed room on the 4th floor was lacking.  Why would you build a new shower and not put in a shelf for soap, shampoo etc?  Where was the magnifying mirror and how sad was the vast and hideous mis-placed attempt at 'cool' that was the piece of modern 'art' on the wall next to our bed.  The stuff of nightmares!

"This title may seem harsh, but I donexpext more from a global brand that boasts of its 4 star glory. The first impressions are strong, a mock renaissance look which clearly was popular in its day. Now this former 80's glam looks like tired decor which has wrinkles all over it. The hotel is going through a refurbishment and I was fortunate enough to be given room 1401 which was a newly decorated room. Take my advise and do not take this room, there are way too many problems here to contend with. The first thing that hits you is the awful odour as you open the door. I would say something is severely wrong in the bathroom. Upon closer inspection the flush doesn't work properly and the basin tap is connected incorrectly.

Title says it all really. Having stayed here a good number of times before I have to say that its a massive fall from its former grace.  Check in was slow and laborious despite being pre booked and paid for. We were informed that the hotel may be a bit noisy that night as there was a function on. I did state that we were not here for a function but a nice restful night and would like a quite room. That was met with a shrug of the shoulders and no more conversation just our room key.   We were located on floor two. Immediately on exiting the lift towards the rooms you were met with a mass storage area for tables/chairs/chandeliers and the like. It appeared that these items had just been randomly placed with no thought of the guest journey.

The hotel is undergoing work to upgrade it and it will be interesting to see the difference after this is completed.  Our evening meal and breakfast were very nice.

Stayed here for one night and attended a conference being held at hotel. Check in smooth and room clean and had everything needed for an overnight stay. Only comment I would make regarding room was taps were covered in lime scale but everything else was spotless. Breakfast was a standard buffet found in many hotels and was well stocked and freshly cooked. All staff  were polite and helpful. Thankfully my company picked up the parking costs as there is a car park associated with hotel but is not owned by them.

REALLY dirty. Hair in the shower and blood on the floor and they smelt. There was a lot of damp around the pool area and it didn’t feel nice being there.   The room was pleasant. Typical room for us.

"We were going to Bristol for the weekend to see Wicked and cancelled our booking because the snow was bad.

The water flow in the shower was not great and the bath was very long but very narrow.The biggest problem was that the room was freezing. The air conditioning was useless and we had to use an oil filled electric heater that was supplied.After complaining that the room was still very cold we were given a second heater which helped but had to be left on all night.We stayed on the weekend of the 24th of February and I dread to think how it would have been a week later when all the snow arrived.,",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/philfinger,philfinger wrote a review Mar 2018,philfinger,"Brighton, United Kingdom",21 contributions,26 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r563871545-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Weekend away.,Date of stay: February 2018,"Response from Abdallah H, Front Office Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

However, obvious things like giving the WIFI code when you check in rather than making you call Reception to get it once you are in the room, providing milk for the coffee and putting two single beds into one for a couple is obvious: when I complained, I was informed that I only needed to call Reception to get it fixed.

"When you first arrive by car, you have to navigate the carpark under the hotel (through the archway) If you have a tall vehicle (4x4) there is only 1 floor available, if full you will have to park elsewhere. Parking here is £16 per night. The hotel is OK but there are certain areas that need some updating, the carpet in our very long corridor was looking worn and there was a trip hazard where the join was sticking up. Room was OK, no choose of pillows just feather ones , duvet not top quality. Breakfast is included in the room price but is like a Premier Inn, buffet style, was it worth twice the cost- no.

The staff was very friendly and helpful - our keys didn't work the first time around and they remedied it and gave us drink vouchers for the trouble - thank you.  We did have issues with the wifi cutting out and then coming back on.    The bar and drawing room were great for a pre-dinner drink and relaxing in the lobby.  The restaurant was great for the breakfast buffet.  One of the better ones we have  experienced recently.  We didn't eat there other than breakfast.

"Yesterday went to an annual Charity Luncheon which was being held for the first time at the Marriott Royal.  Frankly I have never been so disappointed with the quality of the meal and the inept service.  Not what one would expect from such a prestigious hotel.  The food was of a very poor standard.  Turkey main course produced on one plate which had obviously been heated before being served.  Soggy yorkshire, tasteless thin slices of white turkey and vegetables which were either over or under cooked.  Sprouts impossible to cut they were so hard and under cooked.  Starter was mediocre warmish soup and the desert which was probably the best part of the meal was cheese cake.  The service if you can call it that was extremely slow and inept.

Food is excellent, good range, well prepared, service I could not fault and spotlessly clean.  If you have those three I don’t think you can ask for a lot more.  Very central, easy to get around from here, but does not feel like it’s in the middle of a city centre.

I only use the hotel for business travel, and it's very close to the offices, and very close to most shops like Tesco, Sainsbury's, etc. The WiFi is well below average, I've always used the free WiFi (which I measure often) and it's very slow indeed. I've attached a screen image of the last test I did. When I've reported this, I always get told that this is out of my control and that I should call the ISP. I have also been told that the paid WiFi s better, but I think t's criminal for Hotels to make money out of this technology.

"Stayed for two nights at the beginning of December.  The location is brilliant for exploring central Bristol.   The room on third floor facing the cathedral was very comfortable, we had no issues with noise.  A few niggles with the housekeeping - not leaving enough tea/milk - but otherwise the room was clean.  Nearly every single staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. We had issues at breakfast - which I have raised directly with the hotel who have responded promptly and personally.  Mainly they seemed unable to deal with gluten intolerance without it being a complete performance at breakfast, hopefully with my feedback they now get this.

"We stayed over for 1 night to attend a family wedding. The staff at the front desk are charming and helpful. Probably the best hotel welcome for a long time. So the staff training is good.  After that, things went rapidly downhill. Our room was freezing despite turning the heating up to maximum. At 9pm we asked for a spare blanket or heater, as there was no extra bedding in the cupboard. The man at the desk said he would send both up but nothing arrived. By 10.45pm we slept in our clothing to keep warm. The in-built ventilation/ heating duct circulated a strong frying smell as it seemed to be connected to the kitchen extractors.

The bathrooms need to be seriously updated , mouldy tiles, loo seat loose etc.   Not up to Marriotts normally high standard I'm afraid.",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/joneseyoaksey,joneseyoaksey wrote a review Nov 2017,joneseyoaksey,oaksey,144 contributions,183 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r543004172-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html, Very dated and shabby,Date of stay: November 2017,"Response from Abdallah H, Front Office Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"... because this hotel is rather in need of a make-over. It was decorated a while ago and, as well as having some dangerously swirly carpets in the larger rooms, it was all a bit tired.  The room I ended up in (1258 - after asking to move from one overlooking a busy road) was quiet and very well situated, with a view of the cathedral. The food was mixed - some of the conference lunch items were dried out and served in ridiculous spoon-things, which were almost impossible to negotiate standing up (as most people did.) Breakfast was fine, though -   good to have a chef to cook things freshly (on request.) The staff were all particularly pleasant and helpful, which made a big difference to how it felt to stay here.

"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel for a conference and to be honest I will avoid it at all costs in the future. The rooms really need to be upgraded, the shower in the bathroom had cracked grouting and the general maintenance was poor. The first day they cleaned our room but left dirty cups. In the conference area the hand towels had run out by lunch time. There seems to be a general air of people not knowing what they are doing and poor organisation.

"Stayed here recently and yes, when I next visit Bristol, I would return to the Marriott Royal Hotel.  The hotel is not difficult to locate, but the car park is a bit of a nightmare and you’ll require a can-opener to access you car in some of the bays, particularly when a large 4 x 4 parks adjacent to you.     Fair play to the hotel, they are trying to make the most of the hotels available spaces for guests, but when the hotel charges £16.00 a night for the pleasure of trying to squeeze between cars to access the drivers side, it’s a wee bit much.    We were not the only ones experiencing issues.

"Booked a couple of night here as we were attending a family wedding nearby.

First minor grumble was that although there’s on site parking beneath the hotel, it’s £16 for hotel guests per day to park the car there.  That just seemed a bit expensive on top of the room cost.  Quick efficient check in and down to our room on the lower ground floor which was spotless and had plenty of space and all required facilities.

I read reviews for the hotel prior to staying there and worried that it would not be as nice as the official photographs portrayed. The hotel was lovely albeit a little quaint and old fashioned in its decor. I liked it and found the room we had quite nice. The breakfast was nice and the dining room was spacious and well designed.   I wasn’t impressed with the bathroom which was clearly not new and had black grout and stains. However the rest of the room was fine. The location is the most attractive part of the hotel. Situated at the top of college green and near park street was perfect for us. Next to us was the cathedral and aquarium.

"I know this hotel wont resonate with everyone as it's a grand old style hotel,some might say old fashioned, definitely not for those that require very modern accommodation. The staff are extremely helpful and nothing is too much bother. The hotel is in a good location for anyone wishing to use as a base to explore Bristol. Maybe I am just getting old but I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. My only word of caution is to check with hotel in advance to enquire as to whether there are any weddings / parties on the night you plan to stay as it can be quite noisy on the lower floors.",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/PaulTheHelpful,Paul R wrote a review Oct 2017,Paul R,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",84 contributions,19 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r535719390-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,A Beautiful Grand Old Hotel,Date of stay: September 2017,,,,
"Despite the hotel looking quite dated inside, we had a nice stay. The standard room was spacious enough and comfortable, however our shower/bath was leaking. After reporting it the reception staff said they’d get someone to look at it, however noone did. After complaining again the next morning, the reception team were very apologetic and upgraded us to a superior room. The room was very comfortable and no leaky shower!   The swimming pool and changing facilities were nice. I liked the swimming costume drying machine - very useful so we didn’t have dripping wet costumes to take home.   Lots of choice at the breakfast buffet. They close the doors right on 11am so you have to make sure you get what you want in time.

"Sorry to say that the hotel is rather tired looking and ""Fawlteyesque"". Checking in was very slow as I got a trainee. Yes, people have to learn, nowt wrong with that, but at least give them reasonable support; when another staff member checks in 3 people in the same time and I'm the only person left at the desk when it's done.... No standard electrical socket in the room near bed so had to ask for an extension lead. Bedside light did not work so had to ask for it to be repaired. Tried to sign on to Wi-Fi only to be told it was not included and would cost £4.99 (which I refused) or could sign up for their ""club"" and get free (which I also refused) - really quite unbelievable and annoying.

"Everything in this hotel fell short of expectation except the bed. Very dated and tired decor with some areas grubby/dirty. No opening window, air conditioning noisy, clumsy weak shower, no mixer taps, no plug sockets by the bed. Surly staff at breakfast, which was an average offering. Reception staff too busy, concierge on the phone and despite waiting for him, walked off without acknowledging me. A lot of issues could be mitigated if the staff attitude was right but it wasn’t...they are run down and it shows.This place needs a full refurb urgently both physically and in terms of staff attitude.

"All staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful.  The pool/spa area was greatly in need of a revamp.  The changing area was tiny and dirty with clumps of hair in the showers and walk ways.  The interior of the hotel is tired and in need of a revamp.  Also, I found someone else's toe nail on the bedroom floor which was a little disconcerting.

It is also close to the developed water front with a good range of restaurants. With its statue of Queen Victoria outside it is not difficult to imagine in its heyday.

1st stayed at this hotel about 15 yrs ago.  Our stay this time was for 2 nights. On the 1st night we experienced unpleasant cooking smells coming from the Airconditioning.   We brought this to the attention of the front desk and they offered to move us without further question. We were moved to a much larger room with better views and no cooking smells.  I have to commend the staff for dealing with this issue the way they did. We packed our bags and they moved everything whilst we were out sightseeing.

Room - this is a basement room with an awful view of the courtyard (not nice at all!!), the bathroom is nicely laid out but the shower is above the bath which feels like a cheap hotel to me, the cold water tap in the sink did not work correctly either, which made the task of cleaning teeth very difficult.

"We cheekily popped in to use the loo in this hotel when last in this side of town and liked the place straight away so we decided to give it a try for our next trip. We stay in Bristol at least 2 times a year and historically go with the Mercure as this is also to a similar standard but more modern in style and certainly not as grandiose. Our assessment having never stayed but looking at the website was that this place seemed nice but that it gave little extra to justify the high room rate. For a change and as outlined above we decided to use 3 months’ worth of BA frequent flyer points (plus a small surcharge) and try 2 nights here. After a shaky check in, everything was great and all that you would expect from a hotel pitching at this level.

I have stayed here before and booked again a couple of nights before my planned stay on 11th June. Turned up and reception could not find booking.

Now whether the Marriott website which I booked on had an error or whether it was my error I cannot be certain but they would not allow me to switch the date and I ended up booking another room for the night and not being able to cancel the 9th July. I think thats pretty mean and unprofessional.  I decided to write or call in as I had an urgent meeting that night so couldn't be bothered to get all annoyed at reception.

I suspect some people may have lower expectations than me. Some may possibly breathe through the mouth so they aren't able to detect the smells I notice ;-) The air freshener sprayed throughout the hotel corridors and bedrooms via the ventilation system (presumably to mask the smell of ancient carpets) is dreadful.  The carpets are worn and the bathrooms generally look as if they were designed for a look of opulence in the 1990s.  The bed we had was comfortable and provided a good night's sleep.

"Found whats seemed like a great deal with my partner on Booking.com we decide to book this renowned hotel, however unfortunately it has not been the experiences we were expecting. First of all, the parking which is listed as complimentary in the website is not, therefore expect a £16 daily fare if you travel by car, I have tried to discuss it with the Concierge staff with no luck but no biggie. The hotel is itself a marvellous listed building but in desperate needs of an update as the rooms have a old feeling rather than classic.. No mini fridge with only two mini bottles of still water for the guests in the room, a old TV ( most of the programs / movies requires and extra payment..) no USB plugs and a ridiculous extra fare of £4.99 for daily Wi-fi ?

"The hotel is in a great location - the lovely College Green and canal-walkways with restaurants, if you wanted a short stroll, and not too far from the city centre shops, either. The building could do with a bit of renovation (especially, the bathrooms) and I would have liked a small refrigerator in my room (minibar, but not necessarily with any drinks to be purchased, just to cool some water).  Also, the wi-fi was extremely slow. But the stay was enjoyable and the kitchen gets top marks - both for the small snacks in the bar (flatbread with spinach and feta) and the vegetarian food I was served at a large gala-dinner.

I stayed in this hotel on business. We got off to a bad start after it took me over 30 mins to check in. The system didn't have my booking and the hotel was full. I was tired after a long day and didn't appreciate the offer of a free drink in the bar. I saw the manager who was extremely helpful and could not have done more for me to make recompense. The room was nice with a large somewhat outdated bathroom and I slept well. The food is expensive for what it is but I enjoyed both breakfast and room service. The hotel is well located for all Bristol attractions being located in College Green. It is close to the waterfront. ,,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/fluffypolite,Fluffypolite wrote a review May 2017,Fluffypolite,"Madrid, Spain",107 contributions,90 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r486416772-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,A disappointing start to a pleasant stay,Date of stay: May 2017,,,,

"The hotel is typical of a chain 4 star. Some interesting features but somewhat lacking in charm.

On the down side the hotel is a bit faded, the rooms clean but a bit dusty and little things, no tissues and no one answering the phone, an irritation.   The main issue is price.

"We stayed at this Bristol Marriott for a one night stopover and do NOT recommend it for the price - we paid £200 per room.  A lot of reviewers use the phrase ""faded glory"" and this is certainly an accurate description. The communal areas off the lobby are architecturally impressive. But the bedrooms lack 21st century modernisation, especially in the bathrooms which appear to have last been renovated in the 1980s. (See photo.)   We are in two lower ground rooms and both are dim and average. The first room I was given had a leaking air conditioning unit (see photos) - significant water dripping down from the ceiling onto the desk! Not a safe room. It took considerable time, convincing and frustration - late in the evening - to be changed to a safer, cleaner room.

"I visited with recently with two friends.  The underground car park is very convenient and not overly expensive for city centre. I felt confident leaving my car there.  It's really well located, very short walk to the docks, shops and restaurants,    The reception staff were really welcoming, knowledgable and pleasant. We were made to feel welcome from the off.  The public rooms are very grand and well kept.  The pool is small and in a basement, but very nicely presented. Biggest jacuzzi I have ever seen.  I feel the rooms and bathrooms are a little tired but they are clean and super large and quiet. The biscuits were the best I've ever had in a hotel. The beds were really comfortable and it was really dark, so we got a brilliant nights sleep.

You sense the former grandeur of rich Victorian mercantile Bristol wealth as soon as you see the statue of Queen Victoria immediately outside the hotel. Perhaps not the best 'fit' for the Marriott brand. Nevertheless they have kept some of the original fittings in public areas and in the bedrooms: old style victorian taps and mirrored wardrobes for instance. The room and bathroom were spacious and the bed comfortable. In room facilities were at a 4 star standard. Breakfast was very good with lots of service staff at what was a very busy Easter weekend. Checking in and out was problem free with a reception that was also very well staffed. The location on College Green next to the cathedral was very convenient for exploring central Bristol on foot.

"This has been a disappointing visit for a night away with my spouse.  I am a regular Marriott user and have come to expect a decent standard when it comes to rooms, facilities and service.  The staff at the hotel is pleasant and helpful, but the hotel is in desperate need of investment and upgrade.  Carpets are worn, furniture is stained and bathrooms are very dated (e.g., sinks do not have mixer taps).

"Reception staff were very welcoming and efficient. The room on the floor (with a very efficient lift) was quiet with an interesting view over the Floating Harbour and beyond. There was only one easy chair although there was plenty of room for another - that seemed a bit mean in a room billed as 'luxury'.  The bathroom was disappointing. Not only was the sink set into the top which made it difficult to use (a not uncommon fault) but someone thought it a bright idea to mount the towel rail in front of it, making it even more awkward to lean over to reach the sink. This is just bad design.  The Royal is very convenient for the city centre, especially as we were eating at Casamia, just a pleasant walk away, and going to a lunchtime concert at the Colston Hall, equally close.

"A nice-ish hotel, but our room was fairly cramped (it was listed as a deluxe room) and for the price we paid, absolutely not value for money. We paid just under £400 for three nights, and had booked well in advance, so because of this we were a little disappointed. The decor is nice, but a bit ""tired"" looking. On arrival we were informed that on top of the c.£400 room fee and the £48 to park for three nights, we would also be changed a £150 fee for ""extras"", such as room service or the mini-bar, meaning our three night getaway was quickly turning into near £1000 blowout. We were a little taken aback, and insisted that the fee be removed as we knew we wouldn't be ordering from room service or using the mini-bar. A poor show, really.

"Bristol has two Marriott hotels, and although the Marriott Bristol Royal doesn't have a lounge, it is a very nice hotel just off the city centre and close to both shopping and restaurants. Located at College Green, it is a good location to explore the old parts of the city. Whilst the property is a little old the rooms are nice and big and sometimes a little quirky in a good way. They have a decent gym with a good selection of equipment and machines although it cramped in a small place. The leisure club also has a pool and a jacuzzi and a set of beach chairs around the pool area.  The bars and the drawing rooms are nice and has plenty of space.

My first experience of the hotel was the booking process. I booked with a 'pre-paid' rate...stupidly thinking that's that. Just check in online and toddle up to room..NO. Apparently not. I had to pay on the day. This was unexpected and ruined the start of my stay.  The room itself was large but dated. There wasn't a fridge or decent pillows. Two flat pieces of material!

"We have stayed at this hotel at least a dozen times, although the last time was probably at least 3 years ago. There have been some changes. The old restaurant has gone and replaced with a larger, but tastefully decorated restaurant. Also used for breakfast. It's a shame about the old restaurant, because the food was amazing, the new menu looks like quite ordinary food. We didn't eat a meal there. The old bar area has also gone, the space not being used for anything which seems strange. The new bar is too small for the size of the hotel and the amount of people staying. We had to literally fight our way to the bar, because rather ridiculously, a private function was being hosted in the hotel, and instead of directing guests to a function room with private facilities, they were",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/kazzacon,Karen C wrote a review Mar 2017,Karen C,"Tidworth, United Kingdom",158 contributions,69 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r466576086-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,One of our favourite hotels.,Date of stay: March 2017,,,,

"I booked the Royal Suite in this hotel as a very special occasion for myself and my girlfriend which was supposed to end with me proposing to her after spending a romantic night together, unfortunately what we experience rather killed the mood.  Upon arriving to the room, I was first greeted with a beautiful, spacious suite with fantastic views, however, on closer inspection we found that the cleaners must have been on strike in between the previous occupants and ourselves.  Dust on the surfaces, an old champagne cork in the middle of the room and a tv remote control that had been repaired with a sticking plaster didn't immediately convey the luxury advertised on the website.

Amazingly beautiful suit: round room, top floor, nice bathroom with a tub and shower, separate seating and dressing areas - but the room is facing a very popular night club with loud music and drunken patrons going through the night. One of the gorgeous windows could not be completely closed making room quite cold. The heater did not work. This room was the biggest disaster with no rest.  2.

"We stayed 2 nights in mid-December and decided to give ourselves a treat and booked a Royal Suite. On checking-in we cited that the website had stated that there was free parking for suite reservations, which the receptionist said was not correct. Later we confirmed with the duty manager that there were no parking charge. The royal suite had a wide entrance hall, large octagonal shaped sitting room with windows on 5 sides, a good sized bathroom and nice bedroom. We noticed the small portable oil-filled radiator in the sitting room and subsequently found out that you do need this to get the room temperature up to a reasonable level. (I wouldn't like to stay in this room if the weather is really cold). The living room carpet and sofas were stained.

"Have stayed in this hotel many times, it is very convenient for Bristol City centre attractions and right next to the waterfront area bars and restaurants. The hotel does look a little tired but surely this is part of the attraction for a grand hotel in a busy city centre. The restaurant has just been refurbished and looks modern in comparison to the majority of the hotel. I think the car park charges are fair considering how much it costs to park elsewhere but I agree the spaces are a bit small and when I visited ther were several taken up with scaffolding. My one gripe was that the night I stayed it was very noisy from a Christmas party. I was on the 3rd floor and the noise certainly carried to my room.

"We arranged to meet some friends for a pre-Christmas get together at The Marriott. Unfortunately it was the Friday before Christmas so the hotel was heaving with scantily clad party goers who all seemed to want to smoke outside the front door; as the bar is by the front door, you end up freezing to death every time the door is opened!   The bedroom is nothing to write home about...its a standard room, but a bit run down.   My husband left his iPad in the room, and we didn't realise until late on the evening after we departed by which time we were miles away.

I loved it you can just imagine Al Capone and his henchmen walking in (you'll see what I mean if you go there) friendly staff, parking, nice comfortable rooms, cocktail bar & perfect for shopping in Bristol, 5 mins from Cabot Circus, the waterside is even closer with bars, shops, restaurants, if you like hotels as they should be then give it a try, we will definitely be staying there again.

"Upon arrival the car park was full, which was a bit of a pain. It meant we had to park some distance away, which was okay for checking in as we were able to drop our bags at the hotel but difficult for checking out as we had to lug everything with us for the walk back to the car.  At check-in, we found out that our room was a Queen superior and not a King superior. I was disappointed about this, as whilst I know a choice of bed can't be guaranteed, I do feel that because we checked in later in the evening, we didn't get our choice.

"We arrived at the Bristol Marriot with high hopes. The first signs that perhaps it wasn't going to be the trip we expected was when the satnav from booking.com took us onto a cobbled street with no hotel in sight.  After a quick call to the hotel and a new postcode, we arrived at the hotel and were met by very friendly reception staff which was lovely.  Our expectations however were let down by the room. I had booked a suite and was expecting a 4 star experience.  The minibar (which was no longer a minibar), was also not a fridge - however there was no notice to that effect and so I put some drinks in to chill, only to find them at room temperature after we got back from dinner.

For several £££ for one night the suite was very average. The size of the suite was great - however the place looked as if it had been robbed; very bare. Perhaps would have been worth the money if a little effort went into decorating the room with more accessories etc. The bed was also rock hard unfortunately, and we did not manage to get an ounce of sleep - when mentioning this the second morning we were given 20% off the room rate which was a good enough gesture I suppose.

"I've just checked in, only to be told that because I paid by MasterCard I was not entitled to the breakfast I just paid for, included in the room rate. Apparently if I'd paid by Visa my breakfast would still have been included as I was promised. Totally unapologetic front of house staff. So angry that I am shaking with rage. Possibly the last time I stay in the Marriot. As far as my morals are concerned, such behaviour falls within the category of dishonesty.

I am very sorry to hear that you were unsatisfied with your experience with us. For your stay you had booked on a special promotional rate where you would receive complimentary breakfast if you paid using a Visa card. Here is a link showing you the rate rules which you would have had available to you before making your reservation. http://promotions.marriott.co.uk/tcvisa. I would like to apologize if these rules were not made clear enough upon making your reservation.  We value all feedback so we are able to create a better experience for our guests in the future.

I thought my stay at the hotel was very nice although I would not eat there again the food was nice but I was waiting there for about an hour for my food. i never even got the drink i ordered. The rest of the hotel was good the beds were very comfy and the staff were very kind and a good swimming pool. The hotel was quite pricey but the rooms made up for it. I would stay there again but i would eat out.,,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/_justinmarney,_justinmarney wrote a review Dec 2016,_justinmarney,"Devon, United Kingdom",3 contributions,,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r441907317-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,RECENT STAY,Date of stay: December 2016,,,,
"I booked the one night break leisure package in a king sized room and was looking forward to using the leisure facilities.  I was surprised therefore to be told the reason there were no dressing gown and slippers in the room was because these were for suite guests only - surely anyone on a leisure break should be given these?  But in fact we barely used the leisure area as it was so dirty. When I told the girl on the spa desk she just said it was because they were busy!  I was really disappointed by this, having booked this hotel especially because of its facilities.  The hotel staff though were great, (especially on reception) as was the bedroom.",,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Profile/LondonThelma,LondonThelma wrote a review Dec 2016,LondonThelma,london,142 contributions,47 helpful votes,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186220-d192930-r441372138-Bristol_Marriott_Royal_Hotel-Bristol_England.html,Good service but leisure package not as expected and a dirty leisure centre,Date of stay: November 2016,"Response from Felicity W, Guest Relations Manager at Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel

"A lovely, professionally run hotel.  We had a family room - 2 king size beds with views across College Green with ensuite with bath.  Very impressed when we arrived.  We were given the option to book breakfast for the next morning - £10 per adult, under 12 year olds free, so we booked this.  The pool and spa was free to use, and was open from 6 am to 11 pm, closing at 8pm for children.  A lovely pool with large Jacuzzi, a sauna and steam room with showers and water fountain - this was one of the main reasons for choosing this hotel.  The changing rooms are a little tired and old looking, but on the whole, we were very impressed.  During the night we experienced the downside to a view over College Green - Saturday night is quite busy in this area, it seems.

"Yes a bit pricey but got a good deal and the room I got was excellent. Clean, very spacious and generally a calm and classy atmosphere. The staff smiled whenever i walked past them and were incredibly friendly generally.   I'm not sure what more you would want for a room. For the same price on that night I could have got a budget room in a budget hotel but instead I got a great room in a great hotel.

"As a surprise, I booked a long weekend at this Hotel for my wife's birthday. We were booked to see Billy Elliott on the Saturday evening & I wanted something a little upmarket to make the weekend special! How disappointing it turned out to be. I could write pages but to summarise is probably more appropriate: - Room Service Used the 24 hour menu on the first night - the food was uncooked & reheated. Used Room Service at 5.00pm on second day & it took 4 attempts to get through - quality of food much better but really expensive - beware! Afternoon Tea Although both Lounges were fairly busy, the service was appalling, with many customers complaining! It took 25 minutes to order a drink, the staff were delivering the wrong orders to the wrong tables & we didn't receive a bill.

"Stayed here mid week was lovely overall but have stayed in much much better hotels for the price.  Felt like you were paying for the brand not an experience.   Rooms were nice & comfy but missing something you know a bit of zing.  Could of been in any hotel anywhere didn't feel special for the cost of the room.   Rooms were specious and clean. Good facilities, hair dryer, nice to, iron, tea & coffee etc all the things you'd expect from this category hotel.   We had afternoon tea to celebrate a special occasion it was nice again nothing special the drawing room felt very dated and it felt like the staff from the coffee shop area couldn't be bothered to come over. Again for the category of hotel we expected a lot more.  We wouldn't come here for afternoon tea again.

"The Marriott and SPG clubs have just merged and I organised my link after I had checked in but reception were great and organised everything as though I was a platinum member with Marriott - which I am now!  Free drink at the bar, free wifi etc. The only disappointing part was the reception supervisor refused to waive my £16 parking despite being asked by her junior colleague.

Didn't get the rooms that we had requested when making the reservation. On booking I asked for adjoining rooms and rang at least four times to get it confirmed between booking and date of reservation. Each time it was confirmed we had the interconnecting rooms. We arrived in two groups. First group were told we had interconnecting rooms. Second group were told we had interconnecting rooms but we had to wait until the clean was finished which was fair enough. However when we got our rooms they were not interconnecting.

We booked the Marriott in Bristol as it was the nearest hotel to our concert venue. The room looked clean and tidy but the waste bin hadn't been emptied and contained the rubbish from the previous guest. Not the end of the world but it doesn't give you much confidence in the standard of Marriott's house keeping. The biggest problem was we were woken early the next morning by builders filling a skip. When we looked out of the bedroom window all we could see was scaffolding where builders were renovating the adjacent building. At the very least we should have been made aware of the problem when we booked in.
